## ⚙️ How It Works
Users log in based on their role (student, staff, admin). Students initiate clearance requests, which are routed through different departments. Each department can approve or reject requests, and the student can track progress in real time from their dashboard.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Designing role-based UI flows for different user types  
- Building responsive dashboards that work across devices  
- Structuring front-end logic around real-world workflows
